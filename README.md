#INFO 343 FINAL PROJECT #

Our group consist of Cindy Nguyen, Mina Tari, Xingyue Yang, Xiaowen Feng. Our project will be redesigning the companyâ€™s, Blue Stilly Coffee, website from scratch. They are a real company located in Marysville who is interested in a new website design that is more user friendly and has better aesthetics.

## BLUESTILLY.COM ##
Their current website, bluestilly.com, is extremely outdated and their current code is not modern. We plan to use bootstrap and contemporary designs to re-amp the website to make it simpler and make the code easier to comprehend.

## Possible Implementations ##
One possible feature may include is user authentication and connecting to a database. They currently do have those two features but it may be out of our skill range to handle in a week.
